  <!-- GovernmentEntities are lists of GovernmentEntity elements. A
       GovernmentEntity element has only one attribute, which is
       always present, named GovEntityName. Here are some
       representative records. -->

  <!-- Sometimes the name is "NONE". However, it's never the empty
       string (""). -->

  <!-- Most departments, but not all, are given with their full name
       and acronym. Here "Energy, Dept of" should presumably be
       "Energy, Dept of (DOE)", but for some reason the acronym is
       omitted. Note that this is consistent throughout the database;
       the DOE's name is always given as "Energy, Dept of" and never
       given with the acronym. -->
