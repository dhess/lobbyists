  <!-- There are 8 unique government entities in this test
       document. They're representative of all entities for the
       purposes of importing into the DB.

       There are a few duplicate government entities in this test
       document. For most other elements, duplicate testing is done in
       separate unit tests, but government entities are so simple that
       it's more convenient to test duplicates in the main import
       test. -->
