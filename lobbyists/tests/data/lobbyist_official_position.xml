  <!-- OfficialPosition is supposed to state which "covered positions"
       in government a lobbyist has held within 20 years of the filing
       date. In practice, it's unclear how reliable it is. Many
       filings contain lobbyists records whose LobbyisteIndicator (sp)
       is "covered" but whose OfficialPosition is "N/A". Less frequent
       are lobbyist records whose indicator is "not covered" but whose
       OfficialPosition is specific. It's not immediately obvious
       whether which, if either, of these fields is more accurate.

       OfficialPosition is sometimes, though rarely, omitted entirely.
       
       When it is provided, the format of the OfficialPosition
       attribute is fairly free-form. It may be all caps or mixed. It
       may contain punctuation. It frequently lists multiple covered
       positions, usually saparated by a semicolon (';'). -->

  <!-- In the following filing, all of the lobbyists listed as
       "covered" have a value of "n/a" as their position, which should
       not be the case. -->
