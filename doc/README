lobbyists.rng
-------------

This file contains a RELAX NG schema for the Senate LD-1/LD-2 XML
documents. The Senate doesn't provide a schema, so I generated one
using Trang[1] with the following command line:

java -jar trang.jar -I xml -O rng db/*.xml lobbyists.rng

where the directory db/ contained all of the Senate XML documents from
1999 until Q2 2008.

I then added comments to the file in order to document what I've
learned about each element and attribute while writing this parser.

HOWTO.txt
---------

A simple how-to for using the lobbyists API, including some working
Python code.


example.xml
-----------

A very short but illustrative sample Senate LD-1/LD-2 XML document.
