    <!-- This RELAX NG schema was generated by Trang from multiple
         U.S. Senate LD-1/LD-2 lobbying disclosure XML documents. The
         comments were added manually by Drew Hess
         <dhess-src@bothan.net>.

         The Senate XML documents can be downloaded here:

         http://www.senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/database_download.htm

         There is more information on how to interpret these documents
         on the Watchdog.net wiki, here:

         http://watchdog.jottit.com/lobbying_database

         Many of the filing records in the Senate documents contain
         values which don't make sense or appear somewhat (or even
         mostly) unreliable. The comment which accompanies each
         attribute in this schema document provides a "Reliability"
         rating. This rating is my opinion, based on my experience
         writing a parser for these Senate documents and analyzing
         them, of how reliable the values of these attributes are in
         general. (Note that the reliability rating assumes that the
         filing organization is honest in its reporting.) -->

    <!-- There is only one top-level element, PublicFilings. It
         contains a list of one or more Filing elements. -->
    <element name="PublicFilings">
      <!-- Each Filing element corresponds to an LD-1 or LD-2 form
           submitted to the Senate. The elements and attributes that
           make up a Filing element correspond almost exactly to the
           fields on those forms. My guess is that the contents of
           those submitted forms are entered into an Excel
           spreadsheet, and these XML documents are just an XML
           "export" from Excel.

           Note that you can download the latest versions of these
           LD-1 and LD-2 forms here:

           http://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/mac/download.html?file=ld2_mac.pdf

           Note that an older version of the LD-2 form only required
           semi-annual (as opposed to quarterly) submissions. -->

          <!-- The AffiliatedOrgsURL attribute is a bit out-of-place
               in the Filing element. It really belongs with the
               AffiliatedOrgs element (see below). At any rate, it's
               supposed to be the URL of the web site providing
               information on organizations affiliated with the client
               organization when the client is an association,
               coalation, etc. Unfortunately, it often contains email
               addresses; multiple URLs delimited by any spaces,
               commas or semicolons; physical addresses; free-form
               English text; or some combination of any or all of the
               above. As such, it's not a particularly useful field.

               This attribute is new as of 2008.

               Reliability: As an actual URL, mixed, but it's probably
               safe to scan the attribute value for URLs and use them,
               when found. -->

               they're required are quite complicated; see the wiki
               page for more details. Note that LD-1 registration
               forms do not include an Amount field, hence Filing
               elements that are of Type=REGISTRATION never have
               amounts. Occasionally other types of filings omit the
               Amount field, too. In these cases, we can only assume
               that the amount paid, if any, was less than the
               threshold amount required by law for reporting.

               Reliability: No way to know for sure without auditing
               the lobbying firm's books, but presumably very
               reliable, as this is arguably the most important value
               in any filing. It's also safe to assume that incorrect

               with 2007 they're quarterly. Unfortunately, some

               termination report, regular activity report, etc. Most
               of these types correspond to one or more checkboxes on

               reference to the original filing in an amendment
               filing, so you need to come up with some hueristic for
               linking amendment records to the filings they
               amend. Also, amendment filings can themselves be
               amended. The order of amendments can be determined by
               looking at the Received attribute (assuming it's
               accurate!).

                   0 - Active
                   1 - Terminated
                   2 - Administratively terminated

                   Presumably "active" means still employing the
                   lobbying firm at the time of filing, and the two
                   "terminated" codes mean that the client has stopped
                   employing lobbying firm at the time of
                   filing. Unfortunately, in practice these fields
                   appear to be somewhat meaningless: ClientStatus is

                   sometimes "terminated" in a quarterly update,
                   etc. Technically, termination status should only
                   appear in a termination filing, but that's not
                   always the case. Often, in fact, a client with
                   "terminated" status in one filing period appears
                   again with the same registrant in a later filing
                   period. It's not clear whether these discrepancies
                   are because of clerical error, a database schema
                   problem, or something else; but the bottom line is
                   that this attribute doesn't appear to be

                   client/registrant relationship is over until you
                   see the termination filing.

                   Reliability: Suspect. Client status often appears
                   to have no meaningful correlation to their filing
                   types and to subsequent filings. I recommend you
                   don't use this value and instead rely on the Filing

                   Note that many lobbyist elements look extremely
                   suspect. Often a lobbyist is listed multiple times
                   in the same filing, with different statuses or a
                   slightly different name spelling. When the same
                   lobbyist appears twice with "active" and
                   "terminated" statuses, this may indicate that the
                   lobbyist was active during the filing period but is
                   no longer assigned to the client. (The LD-2

                   indicate that lobbyists will no longer be working

                   the accuracy of Lobbyist elements in Senate
                   documents.

                   Note that the House lobbying disclosure document
                   schema has a much nicer representation for
                   individual lobbyist data than the Senate

                   information into a single list, the House schema
                   separates the lobbyist lists into different

                   3 - Undetermined

                   "Active" means that the lobbyist was actively
                   lobbying for the client during the filing
                   period. "Terminated" means that the lobbyist is no

                   sometime during (and after) the filing period. An

                       this attribute is effectively

                       indicates that they've held a covered position
                       often have a stated OfficialPosition of "N/A"

                       indicator value which states that they've not
                       been in a covered position, but then they have
                       an OfficialPosition value that gives a
                       government position. Less frequently, but still
                       prevalent, are Lobbyist elements whose
                       indicator says they're covered but are missing
                       the OfficialPosition attribute entirely.

                       and use its value if you want to know whether a

                   $5000 per quarter to the lobbying activities of the
                   client, or who plans or directs the registrant's

                   association of organizations from a particular
                   industry.

                   Unlike the foreign entity reporting requirements,
                   the registrant is not required to report the amount
                   contributed by affiliated organizations. -->

                       lobbyist's position on specific parts of that
                       legislation, or on government policy in
                       general. Individual members of Congress are

                       attributes, if their offices were contacted as
                       a result of the lobbying activities. (This sort
                       of information can often make up for the vague
